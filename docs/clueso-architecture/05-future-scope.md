# Future Scope

> **IMPORTANT**: The features listed below are **NOT** part of the current MVP implementation. They represent potential directions for future development and scaling.

## 1. Chrome Extension
**Concept**: A browser extension to record screens or grab Loom/YouTube links directly from the browser toolbar.
**Benefit**: Reduces friction by allowing users to start the workflow without opening the Clueso dashboard.
**Current Status**: Out of scope. We currently rely on manual file uploads or copy-pasting URLs.

## 2. Real-Time Transcription
**Concept**: Streaming audio processing to display text as it is being spoken (similar to live captions).
**Benefit**: Immediate feedback for the user.
**Current Status**: Post-processing only. We prioritize higher accuracy and content reprocessing over instant but potentially lower-quality live streams.

## 3. Multi-Language Support
**Concept**: Automatically detecting the spoken language and translating the generated blog posts and social text into other languages.
**Benefit**: Expands the user's reach to global audiences.
**Current Status**: Single language (English) only. The underlying AI models support multiple languages, but the system is not yet configured to handle them.

## 4. Collaboration Features
**Concept**: Shared workspaces where teams can edit transcripts and review generated content together.
**Benefit**: enterprise adoption and remote team workflows.
**Current Status**: Single-user accounts only. Data is isolated per user, and there are no roles or permissions for sharing projects.
