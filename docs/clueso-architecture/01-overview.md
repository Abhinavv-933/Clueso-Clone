# System Overview

## What this Clueso-like system does
This application is a powerful content repurposing tool. It takes video content—whether uploaded files or YouTube links—and automatically transforms it into high-quality written materials. Instead of just playing a video, the system listens to it, understands who is speaking, and turns the spoken words into valuable text assets like blog posts, LinkedIn summaries, and Twitter threads.

## Why it exists in this project
We built this system to bridge the gap between video and text. Creating video content is hard work, but distributing it as written content usually requires starting from scratch. This project automates that workflow, ensuring that every piece of video content can easily reach audiences who prefer reading or browsing social media.

## High-level user workflow
1.  **Upload**: You simply drag and drop a video file or paste a YouTube URL into the dashboard.
2.  **Processing**: The system uses AI to transcribe the audio into text and identifies different speakers.
3.  **Generation**: With one click, the AI converts the raw transcript into polished blog posts and social media updates.
4.  **Export**: You review the generated content and copy it to your clipboard for publishing.

## What problems it solves
It solves the "blank page" problem and the time-consuming drudgery of manual transcription and summarization. Content creators often have great videos but lack the time to write articles or social posts about them. This tool unlocks the value trapped in video files, allowing creators to publish more content across different platforms with zero extra writing effort.
